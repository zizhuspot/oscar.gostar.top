Comprehensive Overview of Multi-Modal Large Models Unveiled: 7 Microsoft Researchers Collaborate, 5 Key Themes, 119 Pages of Content

Microsoft researchers have joined forces to provide an extensive overview of multi-modal large models, covering five key themes in a 119-page document.

A Comprehensive Overview of Multi-Modal Large Models Has Arrived!

This extensive overview, comprising a whopping 119 pages, was authored by seven Microsoft researchers, all of Chinese descent. The document covers two categories of multi-modal large models: those that are already well-established and those that are at the cutting edge. It provides an in-depth summary of five specific research themes:

1. Visual Understanding
2. Visual Generation
3. Unified Visual Models
4. LLM-Enhanced Multi-Modal Large Models
5. Multi-Modal Agents

The report also highlights a significant trend: the shift from specialized to general-purpose multi-modal base models. The target audience for this overview, as per Microsoft, includes anyone interested in learning the fundamentals and latest advancements in multi-modal base models, whether you're a professional researcher or a student.

Let's delve into these five main themes:

**1. Visual Understanding**
This section focuses on the core challenge of pre-training a powerful image understanding backbone. It categorizes methods based on the type of supervision signals used for training: label supervision, language supervision (e.g., CLIP), and self-supervision using only images. Various approaches within these categories, such as contrastive learning and masked image modeling, are discussed. The section also explores pre-training methods for multi-modal fusion, region-level, and pixel-level image understanding.

**2. Visual Generation**
The Visual Generation theme centers on the importance of generating results that strictly align with human intent, not limited to image generation but also encompassing video, 3D point clouds, and more. It emphasizes the use of generation methods that align closely with human intent, particularly in image generation. Specific areas covered include spatially controllable generation, text-based re-editing, adhering to text prompts, and concept customization. The section concludes by discussing research trends and short-term future directions.

**3. Unified Visual Models**
This section delves into the challenges of building unified visual models. It addresses differences in input types, task-specific granularity requirements, and data challenges. The growing interest in developing universal, unified visual systems is highlighted, leading to three trends: transitioning from closed-set to open-set, moving from task-specific to general capabilities, and shifting from static models to promptable models. The report discusses the significance of these trends and how they affect the field.

**4. LLM-Enhanced Multi-Modal Large Models**
This part extensively explores multi-modal large models. It examines background and representative instances, discusses OpenAI's multi-modal research progress, and identifies existing research gaps in this domain. It also delves into the importance of fine-tuning instructions within large language models (LLMs) in multi-modal models and explores the principles, significance, and applications of instruction fine-tuning in multi-modal large models. Advanced topics such as going beyond vision and language, multi-modal contextual learning, parameter-efficient training, and benchmarks are also covered.

**5. Multi-Modal Agents**
Multi-Modal Agents represent a method of addressing complex multi-modal understanding problems by connecting different multi-modal experts to LLMs. The section reviews this model's transformation, highlighting the fundamental differences compared to traditional approaches. It presents MM-REACT as an example of how this approach works. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive summary of building multi-modal agents, their emerging capabilities in multi-modal understanding, and how to extend them effortlessly to include the latest and most powerful LLMs and potential millions of tools.

The report was authored by seven individuals, with Chunyuan Li as the initiator and overall responsible person. The core authors include Zhe Gan, Zhengyuan Yang, Jianwei Yang, and Linjie Li, each contributing to specific chapters.
