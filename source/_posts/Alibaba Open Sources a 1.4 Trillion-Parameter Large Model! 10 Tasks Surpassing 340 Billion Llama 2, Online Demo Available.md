Alibaba has once again open-sourced a large language model, this time with a pure language model called Qwen-14B. It boasts 140 billion parameters, surpassing Meta's 340 billion parameter Llama 2. Qwen-14B was trained on a massive dataset of over 30 trillion tokens, which includes data in both Chinese and English and features a sequence length of 8192.

Like previous models from Alibaba, Qwen-14B is completely open source and freely available. It is currently available for demo on the ModelScope platform.

Alibaba's approach seems to be creating a comprehensive series of open-source large models, similar to Meta's Llama.

In terms of performance, Qwen-14B shows strong capabilities in various tasks, including language understanding, mathematical problem-solving, and even code generation. However, it also faces challenges in certain logical reasoning tasks, similar to other large models.

Qwen-14B demonstrates code generation capabilities by quickly providing a complete Snake game code in Python upon request. It can also call tools and execute Python code for mathematical calculations, data analysis, and data chart plotting.

The model has excelled in various benchmark tests, achieving top rankings in tasks like language evaluation and mathematical problem-solving across different datasets.

To create Qwen-14B, Alibaba used a large training dataset of over 30 trillion tokens, which includes knowledge from various domains, code, and more. They also implemented optimizations in data preprocessing and sample fine-tuning to improve its ability to call tools and enhance its memory.

Alibaba's open-sourcing of Qwen-14B follows previous releases of Qwen-7B and Qwen-VL, expanding their portfolio of open-source large models with diverse capabilities.

Overall, Qwen-14B demonstrates the continuous progress and innovation in the field of large language models and their applications.




Qwen-14B is a large language model developed and open-sourced by Alibaba. It is notable for having 140 billion parameters, making it one of the largest language models publicly available. The model has been trained on a massive dataset containing over 30 trillion tokens, which includes text in both Chinese and English languages, and it can handle sequences of up to 8192 tokens in length.

Qwen-14B is a versatile language model capable of performing various natural language understanding and generation tasks. It has shown strong performance in tasks such as language understanding, mathematical problem-solving, and even code generation. Additionally, it can call external tools and execute Python code for tasks like mathematical calculations, data analysis, and code generation.

Alibaba has made Qwen-14B available as an open-source model, and it is free for users to access and utilize. This large language model represents Alibaba's commitment to advancing the field of artificial intelligence and making advanced AI capabilities accessible to the broader community.



Alibaba Group Holding Limited, commonly known as Alibaba, is a multinational conglomerate founded in China. It is one of the world's largest and most prominent e-commerce and technology companies. Alibaba was founded by Jack Ma and his associates in 1999 and is headquartered in Hangzhou, China.

1. **Alibaba.com:** An online marketplace connecting businesses and suppliers globally, facilitating trade and e-commerce.

2. **Taobao:** One of China's leading online shopping websites, featuring a wide range of consumer products.

3. **Tmall:** A premium version of Taobao, focused on brand-name and quality products.

4. **AliExpress:** An online retail platform that allows international consumers to purchase products directly from Chinese sellers.

5. **Alipay:** A digital payment platform and financial services provider, similar to PayPal, widely used in China.

6. **Alibaba Cloud:** A cloud computing and data services division providing cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and big data solutions.

7. **Cainiao Network:** Alibaba's logistics and delivery network, facilitating efficient e-commerce order fulfillment.

8. **Youku Tudou:** A video streaming platform offering a wide range of content, similar to YouTube.

9. **Ant Group:** A financial technology subsidiary that provides digital payment services, wealth management, and other financial services. (Note: As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there were regulatory challenges for Ant Group.)

Alibaba's growth and success have made it a major player in the global technology and e-commerce industries. The company has expanded its reach beyond China and has a significant international presence. It plays a crucial role in shaping the digital economy and e-commerce landscape both in China and around the world.
