Alibaba has once again open-sourced a large language model, this time with a pure language model called Qwen-14B. It boasts 140 billion parameters, surpassing Meta's 340 billion parameter Llama 2. Qwen-14B was trained on a massive dataset of over 30 trillion tokens, which includes data in both Chinese and English and features a sequence length of 8192.

Like previous models from Alibaba, Qwen-14B is completely open source and freely available. It is currently available for demo on the ModelScope platform.

Alibaba's approach seems to be creating a comprehensive series of open-source large models, similar to Meta's Llama.

In terms of performance, Qwen-14B shows strong capabilities in various tasks, including language understanding, mathematical problem-solving, and even code generation. However, it also faces challenges in certain logical reasoning tasks, similar to other large models.

Qwen-14B demonstrates code generation capabilities by quickly providing a complete Snake game code in Python upon request. It can also call tools and execute Python code for mathematical calculations, data analysis, and data chart plotting.

The model has excelled in various benchmark tests, achieving top rankings in tasks like language evaluation and mathematical problem-solving across different datasets.

To create Qwen-14B, Alibaba used a large training dataset of over 30 trillion tokens, which includes knowledge from various domains, code, and more. They also implemented optimizations in data preprocessing and sample fine-tuning to improve its ability to call tools and enhance its memory.

Alibaba's open-sourcing of Qwen-14B follows previous releases of Qwen-7B and Qwen-VL, expanding their portfolio of open-source large models with diverse capabilities.

Overall, Qwen-14B demonstrates the continuous progress and innovation in the field of large language models and their applications.




Qwen-14B is a large language model developed and open-sourced by Alibaba. It is notable for having 140 billion parameters, making it one of the largest language models publicly available. The model has been trained on a massive dataset containing over 30 trillion tokens, which includes text in both Chinese and English languages, and it can handle sequences of up to 8192 tokens in length.

Qwen-14B is a versatile language model capable of performing various natural language understanding and generation tasks. It has shown strong performance in tasks such as language understanding, mathematical problem-solving, and even code generation. Additionally, it can call external tools and execute Python code for tasks like mathematical calculations, data analysis, and code generation.

Alibaba has made Qwen-14B available as an open-source model, and it is free for users to access and utilize. This large language model represents Alibaba's commitment to advancing the field of artificial intelligence and making advanced AI capabilities accessible to the broader community.
