"Du Xiaoman" has open-sourced its "Xuanyuan 70B" financial large-scale model! It has secured top positions on two authoritative evaluation rankings, and all users can now download it.

Please note that specific details and updates about this model may change over time, so it's a good idea to visit Du Xiaoman's official website or the platform where the model is hosted for the most up-to-date information and downloads.


The latest open-source financial industry large-scale model is here!

Du Xiaoman has recently introduced a new financial industry large-scale model called "Xuanyuan 70B," marking a significant milestone in the development of large financial models.

"Xuanyuan 70B" possesses powerful general capabilities and ranks at the forefront in various open-source model evaluations:

It ranks first in the C-Eval and CMMLU rankings for Chinese task evaluations.

Furthermore, "Xuanyuan 70B" excels in its professional financial capabilities, benefiting from extensive training on financial specialized corpora. It provides professional support and answers for various financial fields, including Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exams, qualifications for banking, securities, insurance, funds, futures, financial planning, and economic analysts.

In summary, "Xuanyuan 70B" features the following:

- It is the first open-source large-scale model with 70 billion parameters and a context length of over 8,000 characters.
- It incorporates a large amount of specialized financial language data during pre-training to significantly enhance its financial expertise while maintaining general English and Chinese language capabilities.
- The model training utilizes a series of acceleration and optimization strategies. With a GPU cluster of 100 A800 (80G) GPUs, "Xuanyuan 70B" achieves speeds of 340 tokens/s/gpu with a context length of 8192, TFLOPS reaching 190, and training efficiency at a leading level.

It's important to note that this model has been fully open-sourced, including model weights and training data, providing a new and more efficient Chinese foundational model for the entire financial industry. Users can also perform custom fine-tuning according to their specific requirements.

Performance Evaluation:
Now, let's take a look at the performance of "Xuanyuan 70B."

(1) Excellent General Capabilities Leading in Multiple Evaluation Rankings:

- C-Eval is a comprehensive Chinese foundational model evaluation benchmark consisting of 13,948 multiple-choice questions covering 52 different subjects and four difficulty levels.
- CMMLU is a comprehensive Chinese evaluation benchmark specifically designed to assess language models' knowledge and reasoning abilities in a Chinese context. CMMLU covers 67 topics from basic to advanced professional levels.

According to Yang Qing, General Manager of the Data Intelligence Application Department at Du Xiaoman and Executive Chairman of the Technical Committee:

"Du Xiaoman will continue to be faithful to the open-source concept, committed to providing high-performance and user-friendly large financial models for financial institutions and research teams. We will continue to optimize the effectiveness of Xuanyuan 70B and gradually introduce the 'Xuanyuan 70B-Chat' model and the 'Xuanyuan 70B-16k' version to meet the needs of different financial scenarios."

Subjective tests conducted by humans indicate that "Xuanyuan 70B" performs well in various types of questions.

(a) Mathematical Calculations:

(b) Code:

(c) Security:

(2) Leading Financial Strength:

Du Xiaoman focuses on addressing the core challenges of large models in the financial field. Traditional general models often lack a deep understanding of specialized terminology, business logic, and formula calculations in financial scenarios, making them less effective in most financial problems. This challenge underscores the urgency of building dedicated large models for the financial industry.

In financial application scenarios, a model's utility often depends on its deep understanding of financial domain knowledge. The financial industry encompasses multiple subdomains, including but not limited to wealth management, credit, insurance, securities, funds, futures, and economic analysis.

To comprehensively evaluate the model's performance in this specific environment, "Xuanyuan 70B" has developed a set of Chinese financial domain knowledge evaluation datasets. This dataset covers 10 major financial categories, 36 subcategories, and includes 7,173 multiple-choice questions, covering a wide range of topics from the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exams to qualifications for banking, securities, insurance, funds, futures, financial planning, economic analysts, and more.

The results show that "Xuanyuan 70B" excels in financial domain knowledge, surpassing various open and closed-source models comprehensively. This not only verifies the model's deep understanding and application capabilities in various financial subdomains but also marks its ability to provide integrated and systematic professional support to the financial industry. The evaluation dataset is also open to the public for community-based evaluations.

To vividly demonstrate "Xuanyuan 70B's" financial capabilities, here are a few application examples:

(a) Financial Knowledge:

In answering questions related to financial knowledge, such as "the four elements of financial regulatory governance," the model not only provides accurate answers but also provides in-depth explanations of the specific meanings and importance of each element.

(b) Financial Calculations:

The financial industry involves a large number of calculation scenarios. When dealing with financial calculation-related questions, the model not only provides accurate answers but also systematically demonstrates its logical reasoning process, proving its strong capabilities in complex financial reasoning tasks.

"Xuanyuan 70B" has not only open-sourced the model itself but also provided an additional 60GB high-quality financial-specific language corpus, which is also available for download.
