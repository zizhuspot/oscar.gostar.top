Chinese Computational Large Model Outperforms ChatGPT in Mathematical Abilities

In the latest rankings, the Computational Large Model developed by Shanghai Jiao Tong University's GAIR (Generative Artificial Intelligence Research) Lab, named "Abel," has achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 83.6%, securing the top position among open-source models. This achievement is particularly significant as it highlights the model's prowess in mathematical reasoning, surpassing ChatGPT and other contenders.

Abel, with its 70 billion parameters, outperformed all open-source models on the GSM8k dataset, solidifying its position as the leader in mathematical problem-solving capabilities. It even surpassed GPT-4 on the new TALSCQ-EN dataset, demonstrating its excellence in mathematical reasoning.

What sets Abel apart is its simplicity in achieving such results. It didn't rely on specialized tools, large-scale mathematical pretraining data, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), or reward models. Instead, it utilized supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which involves training the model with carefully curated high-quality data.

When compared to other open-source models like Llama-2, Abel excels in solving complex mathematical problems. For example, in a variant of the classic "chickens and rabbits in a pen" problem, Llama-2 faced difficulties, while Abel successfully tackled the problem.

Moreover, in a dataset like GSM8k (comparable to U.S. high school-level difficulty), Abel secured three of the top ten positions among open-source models, and it outperformed well-known models like WizardMath. Even when compared to commercial closed-source models, Abel only trailed behind GPT-4, Claude-2, and PaLM-2-Flan.

The research team behind Abel emphasized the importance of high-quality training data. They developed training data that not only contained answers but also provided methods for the model to arrive at the correct solutions. This approach, called "Parental Oversight," enabled Abel's training to excel.

To assess Abel's robustness, the team modified the digits in GSM8k and tested whether Abel could still find the correct answers. The results demonstrated that Abel's 70 billion-parameter model showed better robustness than similarly-sized WizardMath.

The GAIR Lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, led by Associate Professor Liu Pengfei, is responsible for the creation of Abel. The team has previously released benchmarking tools for large models and a fact-checking tool called Factool.

Abel's impressive performance showcases the potential of carefully designed, high-quality training data in enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. This development could have significant implications for various applications in education, research, and industries reliant on mathematical problem-solving.


## who is （Niels Abel）



Norwegian mathematician Niels Abel is celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to the fields of algebra and analysis. Born on August 5, 1802, in Finnøy, Norway, Abel's work laid the foundation for several essential mathematical concepts that continue to be studied and applied today.

One of Abel's most significant achievements was in the realm of group theory. He independently discovered what is now known as Abel's theorem, which addresses the unsolvability of general quintic equations by radicals. This result was a pivotal development in the understanding of the limitations of algebraic solutions for polynomial equations of higher degrees.

Abel's work also had a profound impact on the field of elliptic functions. He made substantial contributions to the study of elliptic integrals and elliptic functions, which have extensive applications in mathematics and physics. His investigations into elliptic functions laid the groundwork for further developments by other mathematicians, including Carl Gustav Jacobi.

Despite his remarkable mathematical insights, Abel faced significant challenges during his lifetime. He struggled with financial difficulties and limited recognition for his work. His pioneering contributions to mathematics were not fully appreciated during his lifetime, and it was only after his untimely death at the age of 26, in 1829, that the mathematical community began to recognize the significance of his discoveries.

In recognition of his profound impact on mathematics, the term "Abelian group" was later coined to describe groups with specific mathematical properties that Abel had explored. Additionally, his name lives on in various mathematical theorems, concepts, and awards, such as the prestigious Abel Prize, which is often described as the "Nobel Prize of Mathematics."

Niels Abel's work continues to inspire mathematicians and researchers worldwide, serving as a testament to the enduring legacy of his groundbreaking contributions to the field of mathematics. His ability to advance mathematical knowledge despite the challenges he faced exemplifies the remarkable power of human intellect and determination in the pursuit of understanding the fundamental principles that govern our world.
