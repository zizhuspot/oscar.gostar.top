Intel, a renowned technology company, is pursuing a strategic approach to quantum computing that prioritizes quality over scale. In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, Intel's strategy is centered on developing high-quality quantum processors and systems before focusing on scaling up the technology.

The key principles of Intel's quantum computing strategy include:

1. **Quality Quantum Hardware**: Intel places a strong emphasis on building reliable and stable quantum hardware. This involves creating qubits, the fundamental units of quantum information, that are highly coherent and less susceptible to errors. Quality hardware forms the foundation for quantum computing's potential.

2. **Error Correction**: To make quantum computers practical for real-world applications, error correction is critical. Intel is investing in error correction techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of quantum computations.

3. **Quantum Software and Algorithms**: Alongside hardware development, Intel is actively working on quantum software and algorithms. This includes developing quantum compilers and libraries to facilitate the programming of quantum computers.

4. **Co-design with Users**: Intel collaborates closely with partners and customers to ensure that quantum computing solutions meet real-world needs. They actively seek feedback and insights from users in various industries.

5. **Quantum Ecosystem**: Intel recognizes the importance of a vibrant quantum ecosystem. They are committed to building a community of researchers, developers, and users to drive innovation in quantum computing.

6. **Scalability**: While quality is the initial focus, Intel also has an eye on scalability. They plan to gradually increase the number of qubits and the overall processing power of their quantum systems as the technology matures.

Intel's approach acknowledges the challenges in quantum computing, including the need to overcome the inherent noise and errors associated with quantum bits. By prioritizing quality and focusing on the development of practical solutions, Intel aims to play a significant role in the future of quantum computing, which has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, materials science, and optimization problems.



"Quality is the key, not quantity."

This is the latest viewpoint on quantum computing by Rich Uhlig, the director of Intel Labs, at Innovation 2023.

When it comes to "quantity," Intel doesn't seem to have the upper hand in the current overall quantum computing industry. Many systems currently have quantum bit (qubit) counts ranging from dozens to hundreds.

In this conference, CEO Pat Gelsinger showcased the Tunnel Falls quantum processor (released in June this year), which has only 12 qubits.

However, Intel's approach is unique in the quantum computing field. They are the only company dedicated to silicon qubits, employing familiar processes and materials with innovative adjustments to create leading-edge qubits. This technology involves using electrons in silicon chips to record the states of qubits.

The embedded Tunnel Falls processor, as demonstrated by Gelsinger, is part of a 300mm silicon wafer containing a total of 24,000 qubits. This approach differs significantly from the standard quantum computing technologies and emphasizes quality over quantity.

In addition to this, Intel is working on another technology in quantum computing, known as "Horse Ridge," a quantum control chip designed to operate at extremely low temperatures. It is crucial for effectively controlling quantum systems, manipulating and reading quantum bit states, and controlling the multiple quantum gates required for entangling qubits.

While quality is the primary focus, the scalability question arises. Can Intel's unique approach enable them to lead the quantum computing race? If history is any indicator, the answer might be yes.

Intel's research logic involves a pattern of "Seek," "Solve," and "Scale." Seeking refers to building a network of rich relationships with external partners, universities, and research institutions. It's not just about funding research but actively participating in collaborative research and publishing papers with partners.

They embrace a cross-disciplinary approach to solve problems, involving researchers from various fields, including integrated circuits, microarchitecture for future CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, system software, programming systems, and compilers. They also focus on emerging workloads, such as AI workloads.

When it's time to scale, Intel leverages its vast resources and execution capabilities to expand their product scale, sometimes reaching tens of millions or even billions of units.

Intel has been actively involved in open-source ecosystems, contributing to the community, and this is one of their scaling methods.

The pattern has been successful in unlocking various technologies known to the public, such as Thunderbolt, USB, and Virtualization Technology, as well as silicon photonics.

Intel's approach to quantum computing aligns with this pattern, emphasizing quality in hardware and control technologies. So, while they may not lead in qubit quantity right now, their strategic focus on quality could position them well for the future of quantum computing.

Intel, a prominent player in the world of technology and computing, is taking a distinct approach to quantum computing, prioritizing quality before scaling. This strategy reflects the company's commitment to developing robust and reliable quantum computing solutions.

### Key Highlights:

1. **Quality as the Foundation**: Intel's strategy places a strong emphasis on ensuring the quality and reliability of their quantum computing technology. The company recognizes that quantum computing, with its unique characteristics, demands precision and dependability.

2. **Quantum Computing Challenges**: Quantum computing introduces new challenges, such as quantum error correction, qubit stability, and noise reduction. Intel is addressing these challenges with meticulous attention to detail.

3. **Incremental Scaling**: While other companies may prioritize rapid scaling, Intel is taking a more measured approach. They believe that scaling should follow once the foundational issues are adequately resolved.

4. **Practical Applications**: Intel's commitment to quality is driven by the desire to see quantum computing move from theoretical possibilities to practical applications. Reliable quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, materials science, and optimization.

5. **Collaborative Efforts**: Intel acknowledges the collaborative nature of quantum computing research. They are actively working with academic institutions and research partners to advance the state of quantum computing.

Intel's focus on quality over scale in quantum computing aligns with the complex and evolving nature of this field. By addressing the foundational challenges first, Intel aims to position itself at the forefront of practical quantum computing solutions, setting the stage for transformative advancements in computing technology.
