Kingsoft, the parent company of WPS Office and Cheetah Mobile, is placing a significant emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) and collaboration as key strategic areas in the current stage of its development. Zhang Qingyuan, the CEO of Kingsoft, recently emphasized the importance of these two components in the company's growth strategy.

AI has become a central element in Kingsoft's products and services, particularly in the context of office software and productivity tools. The company is leveraging AI to enhance its office suite, WPS Office, making it smarter and more efficient for users. This includes features like intelligent document analysis, language translation, and data processing, all aimed at improving user productivity and experience.

Collaboration tools are another critical focus for Kingsoft. With the rise of remote work and digital collaboration, the company is investing in tools and platforms that facilitate seamless communication and cooperation among users. Kingsoft aims to provide comprehensive solutions that enable efficient teamwork, whether for remote or in-office work environments.

Incorporating AI into collaboration tools is also on Kingsoft's agenda. By integrating AI capabilities, the company aims to create more intelligent and proactive collaboration platforms that can assist users in various tasks, such as scheduling, document management, and data analysis.

Zhang Qingyuan's statement underscores Kingsoft's commitment to staying at the forefront of technology trends and meeting the evolving needs of users in the digital workplace. AI and collaboration represent crucial elements in the company's strategy as it continues to innovate and expand its portfolio of software and services.




Kingsoft Office CEO Zhang Qingyuan announced that their intelligent office assistant, WPS AI, based on large language models, has been integrated into all Kingsoft Office products. They invite users to experience the full range of AI features. Additionally, the company showcased the latest progress of their in-house developed models, which are based on open-source foundations and have undergone training and tuning to make WPS AI one of the first AI office applications in China.

Zhang Qingyuan, CEO of Kingsoft Office, stated that AI and collaboration are essential strategic focuses for the company in this stage of development. They aim to use large models to reshape office software and provide users with new experiences in content creation (AIGC), intelligent assistance (Copilot), and knowledge insights (Insight). Furthermore, they plan to empower enterprise customers with AI technology to create their own all-in-one collaborative office platforms.

At the event, Kingsoft Office Vice President Yao Dong showcased the progress of their in-house developed models. By combining open-source foundations with training and tuning, Kingsoft Office aims to lead in the field of AI office applications in China. Yao Dong highlighted that large model technology requires five key elements: data, algorithms, computing power, engineering capabilities, and diverse application scenarios.

WPS AI, powered by large language models such as GLM-130B and ChatGLM, enhances various general office scenarios, including generating presentation content, article continuation, style rewriting, and summarization, offering diverse intelligent productivity services.

In April of this year, Kingsoft Office launched WPS 365, an all-in-one digital office platform for enterprise organizations. During the technology open day, they announced that WPS 365 is now integrated with WPS AI, making it an intelligent office solution for enterprises. This integration helps organizations build intelligent and unique knowledge bases while ensuring data security through encryption technology.

Additionally, the event featured the introduction of an enterprise knowledge base based on WPS AI capabilities. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional knowledge bases, such as high construction costs, vulnerability to internet knowledge, and underutilization of unstructured data. Kingsoft Office's goal is to make office software smarter, more efficient, and user-friendly. With Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, they aim to break through the proposition of pseudo-enterprise digital assets and help build a closed-loop enterprise digital asset ecosystem.

The technology open day was held in Wuhan, reflecting the city's significance as a key research and development base and talent incubation center for Kingsoft Office. As of the end of 2022, over 80% of personnel at the Kingsoft Office Wuhan headquarters are involved in research and development, and the total number of employees has exceeded 1,200. The company has also signed cooperation agreements with several leading universities in Wuhan to promote integrated collaboration between academia and industry. Kingsoft Office plans to continue increasing its research and development investment in Wuhan, establishing it as a key technology hub for the company.
