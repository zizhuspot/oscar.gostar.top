I'm aware that you're discussing the evolution of the ChatGPT app with multimodal capabilities, including the ability to see, hear, and speak. However, I don't have real-time information or details about developments beyond my last knowledge update in September 2021. If there have been significant updates or new features released for the ChatGPT app, I recommend checking the official announcements from OpenAI or their website for the most up-to-date and detailed information on these developments.


It seems like there have been significant updates to the ChatGPT app, making it capable of handling multimodal interactions, including seeing, hearing, and speaking. Users can now upload photos and ask questions related to the content in the photos, and ChatGPT will provide detailed responses. This allows for more intuitive and interactive interactions with the AI.

Some practical use cases mentioned include asking for adjustments to a bicycle seat height based on a photo or opening the fridge, taking a picture, and asking AI what can be prepared for dinner, with the AI generating a complete recipe.

The update is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and enterprise users on both iOS and Android platforms in the coming weeks.

Additionally, details about the multimodal version of the GPT-4V model have been released. It's surprising to note that this multimodal version was trained as early as March 2022.

This development signifies a significant step towards more versatile and interactive AI applications.

However, it's important to consider the implications and limitations of such technology, particularly in terms of privacy and ethical concerns, as well as ongoing research to improve the model's performance and address potential issues.

If you have specific questions or need more details about this update, please let me know.



GPT-4V refers to a multimodal version of the GPT-4 model developed by OpenAI. This version is designed to handle multiple modes of data, including text and images, making it more versatile in understanding and generating content based on both textual and visual inputs. GPT-4V is capable of tasks such as object detection, text recognition (OCR), facial recognition, solving text and image-based CAPTCHAs, and recognizing geographic locations depicted in images.

While GPT-4V shows promise in various multimodal tasks, it also has limitations. It may struggle with precise spatial relationships between objects in images, distinguishing between overlapping objects, accurately identifying foreground and background objects, handling occlusions (objects partially blocked by others), recognizing fine details, conducting deep contextual analysis of images, and providing accurate confidence estimates for its responses.

Additionally, OpenAI has emphasized that GPT-4V's performance may not be reliable for scientific research or medical purposes, indicating that further research and development are needed to address these limitations.

In summary, GPT-4V represents a significant advancement in multimodal AI capabilities, combining text and image processing. However, it still has room for improvement, and its use cases should be considered in light of its current capabilities and limitations.


The capabilities of the multimodal GPT-4V model have been unveiled through various demonstrations and information provided by OpenAI. Here are the key abilities and limitations of GPT-4V:

**Key Capabilities:**

1. **Object Detection:** GPT-4V can detect and recognize common objects in images, such as cars, animals, household items, and more. It has been evaluated for its object recognition capabilities on standard image datasets.

2. **Text Recognition (OCR):** The model possesses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities, allowing it to detect and transcribe printed or handwritten text in images. It can convert this text into machine-readable text, making it useful for tasks involving documents, signs, titles, and more.

3. **Facial Recognition:** GPT-4V is capable of locating and identifying faces within images. It has some ability to infer attributes like gender, age, and ethnicity based on facial features. Its facial analysis capabilities have been measured using datasets such as FairFace and LFW.

4. **CAPTCHA Solving:** The model exhibits visual reasoning abilities, which enable it to solve text and image-based CAPTCHAs. This highlights its advanced problem-solving capabilities when presented with visual challenges.

5. **Geographical Location Recognition:** GPT-4V can recognize and identify geographical locations or cities depicted in landscape images. This indicates that the model has absorbed knowledge about real-world locations, although it also poses privacy risks.

**Limitations:**

1. **Spatial Relationships:** GPT-4V may struggle to understand precise spatial layouts and relationships between objects in images. It might not accurately convey the relative positions of objects.

2. **Overlapping Objects:** When objects in an image heavily overlap, the model might have difficulty distinguishing the endpoint of one object from the starting point of another. Overlapping objects can cause confusion.

3. **Foreground/Background Discrimination:** The model doesn't always accurately perceive the distinction between foreground and background objects in images. It may misdescribe object relationships.

4. **Occlusion Handling:** When certain objects in an image are partially obscured or occluded by other objects, GPT-4V may fail to recognize the occluded objects or miss the relationships between them.

5. **Fine Details:** GPT-4V may overlook or misinterpret very small objects, text, or intricate details in images, which can affect the accuracy of its responses.

6. **Deep Contextual Analysis:** The model might not perform deep contextual analysis of complex scientific charts, medical scans, or images with multiple overlapping text components.

7. **Confidence Estimates:** GPT-4V may provide incorrect descriptions of object relationships, not matching the actual content in the image, leading to potential inaccuracies in confidence estimates.

OpenAI has emphasized that GPT-4V's performance may not be reliable for scientific research and medical purposes at this stage. Further research and development are required to address these limitations and improve its capabilities.

Overall, GPT-4V represents a significant step forward in multimodal AI, but it's important to consider its strengths and weaknesses when applying it to various tasks.
