"DALL·E 3" Begins Beta Testing on Bing! Conquers the Challenge of Drawing a Horse Riding an Astronaut, Generating Images with 50 Specified Objects in a Single Drawing

The development and beta testing of "DALL·E 3" on the Bing platform have been a remarkable achievement. It has successfully tackled challenging tasks, such as generating images that depict intricate scenarios, like a horse riding an astronaut, and even creating drawings that incorporate up to 50 specified objects within a single illustration.

This achievement showcases the impressive capabilities of AI models like DALL·E, which can understand and generate visual content based on textual descriptions and concepts. The ability to visualize complex scenes and ideas through AI-generated art is a significant step forward in the field of artificial intelligence and creative expression.

The beta testing phase of "DALL·E 3" on Bing is likely to provide valuable insights into its performance and potential applications. It will be interesting to see how this technology evolves and how it can be harnessed for various creative and practical purposes in the future.


DALL·E 3 Limited Testing Begins: Microsoft's Bing Takes the Lead

DALL·E 3 has entered its limited testing phase, and Microsoft's Bing platform has taken the initiative to kickstart the testing. This news has generated significant interest among users, although only a fortunate few have received access. In addition to third-party research previews, there have been internal trials by OpenAI employees, resulting in a variety of fascinating test cases.

One of the most remarkable demonstrations involves a challenge where the model was tasked with "depicting 50 different objects in a single image." Astonishingly, the model managed to create images featuring hundreds of objects, far surpassing the initial request. Beyond merely arranging the objects, it also displayed creativity in their composition.

Previously, AI models, including those developed by OpenAI and Google, struggled with creating images depicting counterfactual concepts like "a horse riding an astronaut." This limitation was often cited as a failure case in AI art generation, and it even garnered some mocking from AI pessimists. However, with the assistance of ChatGPT, DALL·E 3 effortlessly conquers such challenges.

The success of DALL·E 3 owes much to its collaboration with Microsoft, though the details of how the image generation component was achieved remain undisclosed, given OpenAI's recent trend of not publishing research papers. What's clear is that this collaboration has deepened the relationship between the two companies, with Microsoft engineers and researchers contributing significantly to the project.

A select percentage of users have already gained access to the testing phase, and the demand for access is high. Due to the limited number of spots available, eager users have been requesting assistance from those who have been granted access. Some users have been curious about DALL·E 3's ability to handle multiple objects within a single image, which is akin to the "context window" in large language models.

Nathan Shipley, a third-party designer who received early access, took on the challenge of depicting 50 different objects within a single image. He first asked ChatGPT to randomly list 50 everyday objects and then requested that these objects be incorporated into a single image. The prompts were filled in by ChatGPT and executed by DALL·E 3. Shipley then asked if the model could create an image of a middle-aged Polynesian male surfer, struggling to balance 50 items, including a teacup, bicycle, umbrella, among others, while riding a wave. The resulting image was remarkably close to the description, although the surfer's expression appeared more panicky than slightly fearful.

There have been other intriguing challenges as well, such as drawing "eight giraffes drinking water," which highlighted the model's difficulty with accurate counting. Additionally, some users have noted that the size of objects in the generated images may not always be proportional, likely due to the model's limited understanding of relative sizes.

Users have also been exploring the level of control they have over the generated images. ChatGPT has indicated that users can provide detailed descriptions, specify the style or medium (e.g., oil painting, photo, illustration, cartoon, watercolor, 3D rendering), request specific resolutions, and even ask for a certain number of images. If the initial result is unsatisfactory, users can provide feedback and request modifications.

It's clear that DALL·E 3's progress is a result of both OpenAI's efforts and its collaboration with Microsoft. While many details remain undisclosed, this collaborative effort has resulted in significant advancements, and it's exciting to see the potential applications of this technology in the future.


As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, "DALL·E 3" does not appear to be a well-known or widely recognized term in the field of artificial intelligence or natural language processing. It's possible that there have been new developments or models created after my last update, and I may not have information on them.

However, I can provide information about its predecessor, "DALL·E," which was developed by OpenAI. DALL·E is a model that can generate images from text descriptions, similar to GPT-3 but for images. It's designed to create images from textual prompts, combining natural language understanding and image generation. DALL·E is based on a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture.

If "DALL·E 3" is a new model or development that has emerged after my last update, I would recommend checking the latest news and research from OpenAI or other reliable sources for up-to-date information on its principles, inventors, and applications.




In a remarkable development, DALL·E 3, the latest iteration of the innovative AI model, has entered the beta testing phase on Bing. This version of DALL·E has exhibited exceptional capabilities by generating images that incorporate up to 50 specified objects in a single drawing, exemplified by a striking image of a horse riding an astronaut.
