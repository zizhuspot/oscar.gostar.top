The 360 Artificial Intelligence Research Institute has unveiled a Chinese-native AI painting model called BDM, which aims to address two major challenges in Chinese AI art creation.

The first challenge is related to style transfer. BDM has the capability to transform existing artworks or images into a specific style, allowing artists to create unique pieces of art while preserving the original content's essence.

The second challenge pertains to fine details and coherence in Chinese paintings. BDM focuses on enhancing the intricate details and overall coherence in Chinese paintings, ensuring that the final artwork maintains a harmonious composition and structure.

By addressing these two core issues, BDM aims to revolutionize AI art creation in the Chinese language, providing artists with a powerful tool to explore and express their creativity while maintaining the essence of traditional Chinese art. This advancement is a significant step in the development of AI-powered tools for artistic expression and creativity in the Chinese-speaking world.


The 360 Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, a part of the 360 Group's technology platform, recently unveiled a Chinese-native AI painting model known as BDM. This model addresses two critical challenges in the realm of Chinese AI art creation:

1. **Accurate Generation of Chinese Concepts**: BDM can precisely generate Chinese semantic images, resolving the issue of AI painting models struggling to generate accurate Chinese concepts. Previous models often produced ambiguous or incorrect Chinese language results.

2. **Compatibility with English Community Achievements**: BDM also ensures compatibility with the achievements of the English-language AI art community. Prior Chinese AI models faced difficulties in aligning with the results and standards of the English-language community, limiting their effectiveness.

Traditional approaches to developing Chinese AI painting models have faced a dilemma. They either sacrificed cost-effectiveness for Chinese language capabilities or struggled to integrate with the rapidly evolving English-language AI art community due to the high cost and resources required for training Chinese models from scratch.

To tackle this challenge, the 360 Artificial Intelligence Research Institute developed a new diffusion model structure called the "Bridge Diffusion Model" (BDM). BDM combines the strengths of both English and Chinese AI art models by integrating a primary model based on Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD1.5) with a parallel Chinese model. This innovative approach allows BDM to generate high-quality Chinese semantic images while maintaining compatibility with various English SD community plugins.

BDM's training strategy involves keeping the primary model's text input as an empty string during training, ensuring that the main model contributes English semantic information while the parallel model learns Chinese semantics. This strategy enables BDM to seamlessly blend Chinese-native capabilities with the existing English AI art community resources.

In the inference stage, BDM provides flexibility in choosing whether to use English or Chinese text prompts, adapting to the user's requirements. It can also integrate with various plugins from the English AI art community, such as LoRA, ControlNet, checkpoint models, and Dreambooth.

BDM has demonstrated impressive results in generating Chinese concept art and adapting to different art styles and community plugins, as showcased in various examples.

This development represents a significant advancement in the field of Chinese AI art creation, providing artists and creators with a versatile and powerful tool for artistic expression while bridging the gap between Chinese and English AI art communities.
