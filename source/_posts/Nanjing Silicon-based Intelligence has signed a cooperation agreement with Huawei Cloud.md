南京硅基智能 (Nanjing Silicon-based Intelligence) is a company or organization based in Nanjing, China, likely involved in the field of artificial intelligence or technology. The cooperation agreement with Huawei Cloud suggests that they are collaborating on cloud computing, AI, or related technologies and services. Huawei Cloud is the cloud computing and artificial intelligence division of Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., a major Chinese multinational technology company. This partnership may involve the integration of Nanjing Silicon-based Intelligence's AI technologies with Huawei Cloud's infrastructure and services or other collaborative efforts in the technology sector.




On September 22nd, during the Huawei Full Connection Conference 2023, Nanjing Silicon-based Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd. (referred to as "Silicon-based Intelligence") officially signed a cooperation agreement on the Digital Human + Pangu Large Model Industry Solution with Huawei Cloud Computing Technology Co., Ltd. (referred to as "Huawei Cloud"). Both parties will collaborate to create industry solutions based on Huawei Cloud's Pangu Large Model and Silicon-based Intelligence's digital human technology. This collaboration aims to enable the integration of digital human technology with large models in various dimensions such as knowledge production, virtual live broadcasting, digital immortality, digital entertainment, and more. The goal is to provide intelligent "Silicon-based Labor" for industry customers. The agreement was signed by Mao Liyan, Co-founder of Silicon-based Intelligence, and You Peng, Minister of the EI Service Product Department at Huawei Cloud.

Silicon-based Intelligence, as a leading company in commercializing artificial intelligence in China, introduced the world's first AI phone robot in 2017, launched commercial digital human products in 2018, and unveiled the world's first AIGC digital human in 2019. Silicon-based Intelligence has developed a range of pioneering digital human products, including ultra-realistic digital human clones, Silicon Language video platforms, digital human live broadcasting platforms, and the DUIX interaction platform. The company has cloned over 400,000 digital avatars and serves nearly 10,000 enterprises in more than ten industries. Silicon-based Intelligence has invested significantly in independent research and development in the digital human field, resulting in over 90 AI invention patents and more than 10 overseas invention patents.

To accelerate the implementation of AI across various industries, Huawei Cloud has consistently followed the direction of "AI for Industries," integrating AI technology with industry knowledge. Leveraging the Pangu Large Model, Huawei Cloud has continued to innovate in various industries, including government, finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, empowering intelligent upgrades across different sectors. Huawei Cloud will utilize its advantages in algorithms, computing power, talent, technology, and market presence to focus on building digital human brain capabilities in collaboration with Silicon-based Intelligence.

The collaboration between Silicon-based Intelligence and Huawei Cloud aims to combine their respective strengths to accelerate innovation in digital human + large model integrated product solutions. By delivering intelligent "Silicon-based Labor" to various industries, they seek to realize the concept of technological equity in areas such as government services, education, healthcare, and finance, thereby enhancing enterprise productivity and service efficiency. Both parties will also work on building the digital human industry ecosystem, joint brand marketing, industry market development, customer service, and other aspects to achieve mutually beneficial cooperation.




An AI phone robot, also known as a conversational AI agent or virtual assistant, is an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to interact with humans over the phone in a natural and human-like manner. These systems are built using sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, allowing them to understand spoken language, recognize voice patterns, and generate appropriate responses.

The primary purpose of AI phone robots is to automate customer service and support functions. They can handle a wide range of tasks, including answering frequently asked questions, providing information about products or services, scheduling appointments, processing transactions, and even resolving issues or complaints. By doing so, they can significantly enhance operational efficiency, reduce human resource costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

AI phone robots are trained on vast datasets of recorded human interactions, which help them learn the nuances of language, tone, and context. Some advanced AI phone robots can also adapt their responses based on the emotional cues detected in the caller's voice, making the interactions more personalized and empathetic.

In addition to their role in customer service, AI phone robots find applications in various industries, including healthcare (for appointment reminders and telehealth services), finance (for account inquiries and fraud detection), and more. They provide 24/7 availability, quick response times, and consistent service quality, making them a valuable asset for businesses seeking to streamline their communication processes and enhance the overall customer experience. As AI technology continues to advance, AI phone robots are expected to become even more capable and integrated into various aspects of our daily lives.
