Intel, a leading technology company, has taken a strategic approach to quantum computing that emphasizes quality before scale.

Quantum computing is an emerging field that holds the promise of solving complex problems beyond the capabilities of classical computers. However, building practical and scalable quantum computers remains a significant challenge.

Intel's strategy in the quantum computing space is distinctive in its focus on ensuring the quality and reliability of its quantum hardware and software components before aiming for large-scale deployment. This approach is based on several key principles:

1. **Qubit Quality:** Intel prioritizes the quality of its qubitsâ€”the fundamental units of quantum information processing. Qubits must be highly stable and resistant to errors, which is critical for error correction and achieving practical quantum advantage.

2. **Cryogenic Control:** Quantum computers operate at extremely low temperatures near absolute zero. Intel invests in cryogenic control systems to maintain the stability of qubits, which is essential for reliable quantum operations.

3. **Quantum Software:** Developing robust quantum software is as crucial as building the hardware. Intel focuses on creating a quantum software stack that can efficiently utilize quantum hardware and enable quantum applications.

4. **Research Partnerships:** Intel collaborates with leading research institutions and partners to advance the field of quantum computing collectively. These collaborations aim to accelerate progress and share knowledge.

5. **Quantum Ecosystem:** Building a thriving quantum ecosystem involves working with developers, researchers, and businesses to explore potential applications and use cases for quantum computing.

Intel acknowledges that achieving large-scale quantum computing will be a gradual process, and it prioritizes quality over rushing to build quantum machines with hundreds or thousands of qubits. Quality assurance is essential to ensure quantum systems can deliver reliable and meaningful results.

In summary, Intel's quantum computing strategy is characterized by a commitment to advancing the field methodically, with a strong emphasis on qubit quality, cryogenic control, quantum software, research collaborations, and ecosystem development. By focusing on these principles, Intel aims to contribute to the development of practical and scalable quantum technologies in the future.


"Quality matters more than quantity."

This is the latest viewpoint on quantum computing from Rich Uhlig, the Director of Intel Labs, as shared during Innovation 2023.

In terms of "quantity," Intel doesn't currently dominate the quantum computing industry. Many quantum systems today have qubit counts ranging from tens to hundreds. Even Intel's Tunnel Falls quantum processor, demonstrated by CEO Gelsinger during the event, has just 12 qubits.

However, Intel's confidence in making this statement stems from its unique approach to quantum computing, which can be described as somewhat unconventional. As described by Chief Technology Officer Greg Lavender:

"We are the only company committed to silicon qubits. We've taken the familiar process and materials from the microprocessor world and made innovative adjustments to create leading qubits."

This approach involves using technology closer to traditional microprocessor manufacturing to leverage electrons within silicon chips to record quantum bit (qubit) states. During the event, Gelsinger showcased a 300mm silicon wafer embedded with the Tunnel Falls processor, accommodating a total of 24,000 qubits.

Furthermore, Rich Uhlig mentioned that Intel is working on another technology in the quantum control domain. They have developed a quantum control chip, known as "Horse Ridge," which operates at extremely low temperatures and efficiently controls quantum systems. This chip allows for manipulation and reading of quantum bit states and the control of multiple quantum gates required for entanglement. Intel believes this will be a key factor in scaling quantum computing and enabling the expansion of quantum bits in the future.

Intel's approach follows a pattern of "Seek," "Solve," and "Scale," which has been instrumental in its exploratory and innovative technologies. For "Seek," Intel collaborates extensively with external partners, including universities, to build a rich network of relationships. It's not just about funding research but also actively participating and publishing joint research. They embrace a culture of mutual learning.

Intel also emphasizes interdisciplinary approaches for "Solve," covering various domains derived from integrated circuits. This approach encompasses research on future CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, system software, programming systems, and compilers. They explore various emerging workloads, such as AI workloads, and remain at the forefront of technology trends.

When Intel's research institute is ready to scale, it leverages Intel's strength and robust execution capabilities to bring their projects to a scale of tens of millions or even hundreds of millions.

Intel's active involvement in the open-source community plays a significant role in its scaling strategy. This model has unlocked many widely recognized technologies over the years, such as Thunderbolt and USB.

In conclusion, Intel's approach to quantum computing prioritizes quality over quantity. Their commitment to silicon qubits and innovative technologies, such as Horse Ridge, showcases their unique path in the quantum computing space. By adhering to a systematic approach of "Seek," "Solve," and "Scale," Intel aims to contribute significantly to the development of practical and scalable quantum technologies.


Intel, a prominent technology and computing company, is adopting a distinctive approach to quantum computing, where the primary emphasis is on ensuring the quality and reliability of their quantum computing technology before pursuing large-scale implementation.

### Key Highlights:

1. **Quality-Centric Strategy**: Intel's strategy revolves around achieving the highest possible quality and reliability in their quantum computing technology. This approach acknowledges the unique challenges posed by quantum computing, which demands precision and dependability.

2. **Challenges in Quantum Computing**: Quantum computing introduces a set of challenges, including quantum error correction, qubit stability, and minimizing noise. Intel is investing significant efforts to address these issues with meticulous attention to detail.

3. **Incremental Scaling**: While other players in the field might prioritize rapid scaling, Intel has opted for an incremental approach. The company believes that scaling should come after addressing the foundational challenges to ensure that large-scale quantum computing is stable and reliable.

4. **Practical Applications**: Intel's commitment to quality is driven by the desire to see quantum computing move from theoretical possibilities to practical applications. Reliable quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, materials science, and optimization.

5. **Collaborative Efforts**: Intel recognizes the collaborative nature of quantum computing research and is actively engaged with academic institutions and research partners to advance the state of quantum computing.

Intel's decision to prioritize quality in quantum computing before pursuing large-scale implementation underscores the complexity and uniqueness of this field. By meticulously addressing foundational issues, Intel aims to position itself at the forefront of practical quantum computing solutions, setting the stage for transformative advancements in computing technology.
