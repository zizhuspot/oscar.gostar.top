The Great Wall Motors Group, a prominent Chinese automotive manufacturer, is making significant strides in the field of smart technology. Their latest developments include the integration of SpaceGPT into their vehicles, the deployment of urban NOA (Navigation on Automation) systems in 100 cities, and the leadership of Yang Jifeng in their AI Lab.


Long-standing automaker Great Wall Motors, with a market value of over a hundred billion, has recently disclosed its latest developments in smart technology, including Smart Space, large-scale model integration, and plans to deploy Urban Navigation on Automation (NOA) in 100 cities next year.

Great Wall's sudden push into smart technology comes as the company has faced slowing sales growth and declining profits over the past two years.

According to their 2023 semi-annual report, Great Wall Motors achieved an operating income of 69.971 billion yuan in the first half of 2023, a year-on-year increase of 12.61%. However, the net profit attributable to shareholders was 1.361 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 75.69%.

To revitalize its position, Great Wall needs to embark on a new smart technology journey and keep pace with other automakers.

Great Wall actually started its smart technology journey relatively early. In June 2021, the company officially launched its smart technology brand, "Coffee Intelligence." Currently, "Coffee Intelligence" includes four products: the self-developed smart cockpit system (Coffee OS), smart driving system (Coffee Pilot), smart cloud (Coffee Cloud), and electronic electrical architecture (Coffee GEEP).

What's different about Great Wall is its aspiration to create a "unified platform architecture" that covers all vehicle models, series, brands, and globalization from the beginning, rather than having multiple teams work on cockpit and smart driving development as seen in some other automakers.

Here's a breakdown of Great Wall's latest advancements:

**Smart Driving:** Great Wall has been investing in smart driving technology for a while. In 2019, they incubated the autonomous driving technology company Haomo Zhixing. In early 2021, three founders from Haomo took over key roles at Coffee Intelligence, Great Wall's smart driving arm. Great Wall plans to deploy low, medium, and high-level computing platforms for smart driving across multiple brands to create cost-effective smart driving experiences tailored to different customer needs. They are planning to land Urban NOA in 100 cities by the end of 2024.

**Smart Cockpit:** Great Wall introduced Coffee OS 1.0 and Coffee OS 2.0 in 2021. The intelligent cockpit operating system currently used in models such as Pao (枭龙MAX), Second Generation Big Dog (二代大狗), and Blue Mountain (蓝山) is Coffee OS 2.0. It has improved significantly compared to the previous version, providing faster voice recognition and more accurate command interpretation. Great Wall plans to release Coffee OS 3.0 in the first half of 2024.

**AI Lab:** Great Wall established an AI Lab, a forward-looking AI technology research center, to focus on cutting-edge AI technologies. Led by Yang Jifeng, who has a background in mechanical engineering and significant experience in the automotive and autonomous driving industries, the AI Lab aims to drive innovation in AI-related areas and ensure Great Wall remains competitive in the era of AI-defined automobiles.

Great Wall's commitment to advancing smart technology demonstrates its determination to remain at the forefront of the automotive industry, competing with both traditional automakers and new disruptors. By integrating AI, smart driving, and intelligent cockpit systems across its brand portfolio, Great Wall is positioning itself to meet the evolving demands of customers in the smart mobility era.


SpaceGPT is a term referring to a concept or technology that uses GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, which are advanced AI language models, to provide intelligent assistance or recommendations in various spatial contexts. These spatial contexts can include physical environments, such as smart homes, offices, or vehicles, where AI-driven systems offer insights, suggestions, or actions based on user interactions and the surrounding environment.

SpaceGPT leverages natural language processing and machine learning capabilities to understand and respond to user queries or commands related to their surroundings. For example, it could help control smart devices in a home, suggest optimal routes and actions while driving, or assist with tasks in an office setting. SpaceGPT systems aim to enhance user experiences by seamlessly integrating AI-driven intelligence into real-world spaces.

It's important to note that the term "SpaceGPT" may not represent a specific, widely recognized technology or product as of my last knowledge update in September 2021. However, it aligns with the broader trend of integrating AI models like GPT into various applications to create smarter and more context-aware environments for users.


Great Wall SpaceGPT has embarked on an extensive exploration of smart technology, marked by the deployment of "Urban NOA" in 100 cities. Spearheading this venture is Yang Jifeng, who leads the company's AI Lab.

Key Highlights:

1. **Expansion into Smart Technology**: Great Wall SpaceGPT is taking significant strides in the realm of smart technology, signifying its commitment to innovation and technological advancement.

2. **Urban NOA Deployment**: The deployment of "Urban NOA" in 100 cities is a remarkable achievement. This initiative likely encompasses a range of smart city solutions, aimed at enhancing urban living, infrastructure, and sustainability.

3. **Leadership by Yang Jifeng**: Yang Jifeng's role as the head of Great Wall SpaceGPT's AI Lab is pivotal. His leadership and expertise are expected to drive the development of cutting-edge AI technologies and applications.

4. **AI in Urban Development**: The deployment of AI-driven technology in urban settings has the potential to revolutionize city management, transportation, and various aspects of daily life.

5. **Pioneering Innovation**: Great Wall SpaceGPT's foray into smart technology and urban AI solutions showcases its pioneering spirit and commitment to shaping the future of technology in urban environments.

This significant development underscores the company's commitment to smart technology and its potential to transform urban living. Yang Jifeng's leadership and the deployment of "Urban NOA" in numerous cities indicate that Great Wall SpaceGPT is at the forefront of innovation in the AI and smart technology landscape.
